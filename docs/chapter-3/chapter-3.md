# Chapter 3 : Drawing meshes

After we managed to render a triangle, its time to render more.
Right now we are hardcoding the triangle, but we want to render any mesh, so lets implement proper mesh rendering.

By the end of the chapter, you will be able to render as many simple objects as you want, forming a 3d world.
