# Chapter 3 : Drawing meshes

After we managed to render a triangle, its time to render more.
We can now longer hardcode the vertex positions, so we will explain how to send proper meshes to vulkan, and render complex object.
By the end of the chapter, you will be able to render as many simple objects as you want, forming a 3d world.
